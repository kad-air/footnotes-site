### Hogwarts Castle

You pass through the great oak doors, permission slip clutched in hand. The autumn air carries the scent of fallen leaves as you begin the familiar path to the village.

---

### The Greenhouses
📍 56.692, -5.445

Professor Sprout waves from Greenhouse Three as you pass. Mandrakes can be heard wailing faintly through the glass. The path winds downhill from here.

### The Shrieking Shack
📍 56.700, -5.460

The most haunted building in Britain looms on the hill. Its boarded windows hide secrets—though perhaps not the ones the villagers believe.

### Dervish and Banges
📍 56.706, -5.472
📏 450m

Sneakoscopes spin in the window, and a display of Remembralls glows faintly. All manner of magical instruments and equipment can be found within.

---

### Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop
📍 56.709, -5.478
📏 380m

Peacock feather quills, self-inking nibs, and rolls of finest parchment. You could spend an hour just admiring the calligraphy samples.

---

### Gladrags Wizardwear
📍 56.711, -5.482
📏 320m

Colorful socks that shriek when they get too smelly, and robes for every occasion. Luna swears by their dirigible plum earrings.

### Zonko's Joke Shop
📍 56.713, -5.485
📏 280m

Dungbombs, Hiccough Sweets, and Nose-Biting Teacups line every shelf. Fred and George's spiritual home before they opened their own shop.

---

### Honeydukes
📍 56.715, -5.488
📏 310m

The sweet smell hits you before you open the door. Chocolate Frogs, Fizzing Whizzbees, Sugar Quills, and every magical confection imaginable.

### The Post Office
📍 56.717, -5.491
📏 290m

Hundreds of owls roost on color-coded shelves, from tiny Scops to great grey delivery birds. Letters flutter through enchanted sorting chutes.

### Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop
📍 56.719, -5.494
📏 260m

Frills, bows, and floating cherubs. Couples hold hands over tiny tables. Perhaps a bit too romantic for a casual visit with friends.

---

### The Hog's Head
📍 56.721, -5.497
📏 340m

Sawdust floors and a barman who asks no questions. The clientele prefer their hoods up. A certain secret society once held meetings upstairs.

---

### The Three Broomsticks
📍 56.723, -5.500

Madam Rosmerta serves the best Butterbeer in Britain. Warm, crowded, and full of gossip—the perfect end to a Hogsmeade weekend.
