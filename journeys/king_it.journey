## Waypoints

### Kansas Street
📍 44.8012, -68.7784
📏 2400m

Bill Denbrough's house. The place where it all began, where Georgie folded his paper boat and
stepped out into the rain. "He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees
the ghosts." The stutter is back. The fear is back. Everything is back.

---

### The Kenduskeag Stream
📍 44.7897, -68.7701
📏 3200m

You follow the stream where Georgie's boat sailed into darkness. The paper boat floated here,
drawn by currents older than Derry itself. Down in the storm drain, something waited. Something
that still waits. The water runs red in your imagination.

---

### The Derry Public Library
📍 44.8016, -68.7718
📏 4100m

Ben Hanscom spent countless hours here, researching the dark history of Derry. The explosion at
the Ironworks. The fire at the Black Spot. Every twenty-seven years, the cycle repeats. The
librarian smiles too wide as you enter. The books seem to whisper.

---

### The Standpipe
📍 44.8156, -68.7533
📏 5800m

Thomas Hill Standpipe rises against the gray Maine sky. Stan Uris saw the dead boys here,
drowned children floating in the dark water tank. The door creaks open on its own. You could
climb up. You could look inside. But some doors are better left closed.

---

### Neibolt Street
📍 44.7912, -68.8042
📏 6200m

29 Neibolt Street. The house of horrors. Windows like dead eyes, weeds choking the yard, and
somewhere inside, a door to the macroverse. Eddie broke his arm here. Richie saw the werewolf.
Bill saw Georgie's ghost. "This is battery acid, you slime!" The house wants you to come inside.

---

### The Barrens
📍 44.7734, -68.7856
📏 7400m

The Losers' clubhouse was here, underground, a secret place where seven kids became something
more. The dam they built. The smoke-hole ritual. Silver. The Losers built more than a club—they
built a circle. And circles, once made, cannot easily be broken.

---

### The Kissing Bridge
📍 44.7523, -68.7667
📏 8900m

The covered bridge where lovers carve their initials. Ben carved "B + B" here, for Beverly.
The wood is old, carved with decades of promises and secrets. Some initials have lasted. Some
have faded. Some were carved by children who never grew up.

---

### The Derry Town House
📍 44.8019, -68.7727
📏 5600m

Where the adult Losers reunited after Mike's call. Twenty-seven years gone, but the fear
returned in an instant. The fortune cookies cracked open to reveal blood and eyeballs. Stanley
didn't come. Stanley couldn't come. But six of seven will have to be enough.

---

### Center Street
📍 44.7908, -68.7817
📏 4200m

The heart of Derry, where Paul Bunyan's statue winks at passing children. The Canal Days parade
passed here before the blood began to flow. Shop windows reflect your face—and sometimes
something else. A red balloon floats by, against the wind.

---

### The Canal
📍 44.7812, -68.7723

The entrance to the sewers. The entrance to It's lair. Derry's storm drains all lead here,
and all flow down into darkness. "They all float down here." Bill led them down once as
children, and again as adults. In the deadlights, there is no time. There is only It.
