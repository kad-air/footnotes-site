## Waypoints

### Bree

You lead the four hobbits out of the East-gate under the cover of darkness. The road ahead is long, and the Nine are never far behind.

### Midgewater Marshes
📍 -41.280, 174.850
📏 45000m

Neeker-breekers and midges haunt the stagnant pools. Every step is a struggle through the muck, but it keeps you off the main road.

### The Weather Hills
📍 -41.200, 174.950

Rugged land where the wind never stops. You keep low, using the ridgelines to shield your movement from prying eyes on the horizon.

The Hoarwell flows beneath the ancient stone. You find a single elf-stone on the road—a sign from Glorfindel that the way is still open.

### The Trollshaws
📍 -41.120, 175.100

You find three stone giants—the very trolls Bilbo encountered years ago. The air is heavy with the scent of pine and ancient magic.

### The Ford of Bruinen
📍 -41.105, 175.150
📏 8000m

Frodo rides alone as the Black Riders close in. 'Noro lim, Asfaloth!' The river rises in a great wave, white horses of water crushing the Nazgûl.

### Rivendell
📍 -41.100, 175.100

The Last Homely House east of the Sea. Elrond's healing touch saves the Ring-bearer, and the Council prepares for the journey ahead.
