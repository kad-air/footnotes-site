## Waypoints

### Bree
📍 -41.300, 174.788

You lead the four hobbits out of the East-gate under the cover of darkness. The road ahead is long, and the Nine are never far behind.

---

### Midgewater Marshes
📍 -41.235, 174.898
📏 45000m

Neeker-breekers and midges haunt the stagnant pools. Every step is a struggle through the muck, but it keeps you off the main road.

### The Weather Hills
📍 -40.935, 175.248
📏 85000m

Rugged land where the wind never stops. You keep low, using the ridgelines to shield your movement from prying eyes on the horizon.

### The Last Bridge
📍 -40.365, 175.908
📏 35000m

The Hoarwell flows beneath the ancient stone. You find a single elf-stone on the road—a sign from Glorfindel that the way is still open.

### The Trollshaws
📍 -40.135, 176.178
📏 22000m

You find three stone giants—the very trolls Bilbo encountered years ago. The air is heavy with the scent of pine and ancient magic.

### The Ford of Bruinen
📍 -39.995, 176.358
📏 8000m

Frodo rides alone as the Black Riders close in. 'Noro lim, Asfaloth!' The river rises in a great wave, white horses of water crushing the Nazgul.

---

### Rivendell
📍 -39.945, 176.428

The Last Homely House east of the Sea. Elrond's healing touch saves the Ring-bearer, and the Council prepares for the journey ahead.
