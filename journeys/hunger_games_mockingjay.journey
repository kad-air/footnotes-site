## Waypoints

### District 2 (The Nut)
📍 39.739, -104.990
📏 42000m

The mountain fortress has fallen. You stand at the staging ground, watching the rebel forces gather. The 'Star Squad' is formed—not for the front lines, but for the cameras. Or so they say.

---

### The Capitol Outskirts
📍 40.750, -111.880
📏 18000m

You cross the perimeter. The luxury of the suburbs is a mask for the 'pods'—hidden lethal traps triggered by movement. Every block is a potential death sentence.

---

### The Meat Grinder
📍 40.760, -111.890
📏 12000m

Boggs is gone. The Holo is in your hands now. You must lead the squad through a street that has turned into a literal grinder of black oil and ancient machinery.

---

### The Sewers
📍 40.765, -111.895
📏 15000m

Into the dark. The stench is overwhelming, and the sound of hissing 'Mutts' echoes through the pipes. You're no longer just avoiding peacekeepers—you're being hunted by monsters.

---

### Tigris's Shop
📍 40.768, -111.898
📏 18000m

A former stylist with the face of a tiger hides you behind a wall of fur coats. A brief moment of warmth and real food before the final push to the City Circle.

---

### The Mansion Gates
📍 40.770, -111.900

The City Circle is a war zone. You see the children behind the silver parachutes. The Mockingjay has reached the end of her walk. The Capitol is yours.
