## Waypoints

### District 2 (The Nut)
📍 40.000, -105.000
📏 12000m

The mountain fortress has fallen. You stand at the staging ground, watching rebel forces gather from across Panem. The "Star Squad" is formed—officially for the cameras, to shoot propaganda footage of the Mockingjay. But you have other plans.

---

### Rebel Staging Camp
📍 40.100, -104.950
📏 13000m

Coin's orders are clear: stay behind the front lines, look heroic, don't engage. But Boggs knows the truth. He's seen your face when you think no one's watching. The Holo he carries shows every pod in the Capitol. Every death trap.

---

### The Capitol Perimeter
📍 40.200, -104.880
📏 13000m

You cross into Capitol territory. The manicured lawns and pristine streets feel wrong—too perfect, too quiet. Somewhere beneath your feet, sensors wait. The first pods are nearby. One wrong step and the street itself becomes a weapon.

---

### Outer Suburbs
📍 40.300, -104.800
📏 12000m

The luxury of the suburbs is a mask. Behind every fountain, inside every decorative column, death waits. Mitchell triggers a pod—a net of barbed wire that shreds through armor like paper. You're learning: in the Capitol, beauty is always a lie.

---

### First Blood
📍 40.380, -104.730
📏 12000m

The explosion takes Boggs's legs. As he dies, he transfers the Holo to you—command of the mission, whether you want it or not. "Don't trust them," he whispers. "Kill Peeta. Do what you came to do." The squad looks to you now.

---

### The Meat Grinder
📍 40.460, -104.650
📏 13000m

A wave of black oil floods the street, followed by something worse—a machine that devours everything in its path. Messalla is gone in seconds. You're not soldiers anymore. You're prey, running through a game maker's nightmare.

---

### Into the Tunnels
📍 40.550, -104.560
📏 12000m

The only way forward is down. You descend into the transfer tunnels beneath the Capitol—maintenance passages never meant for citizens' eyes. It's dark. It smells of chemicals and rot. But at least there are no pods down here. At least, that's what you hope.

---

### The Sewers
📍 40.640, -104.480
📏 10000m

The hissing starts in the darkness. Mutts—eyeless, pale things bred to hunt by sound and smell. Finnick holds them back with his trident, buying time for the others. "Katniss!" The mutts drag him down. You can still hear him screaming as you run.

---

### Tigris's Shop
📍 40.710, -104.420
📏 7000m

A former stylist—her face surgically altered to resemble a tiger—hides you behind racks of fur coats. For one night, you're safe. You eat real food. You sleep. But through the shop windows, you can see the City Circle. Snow's mansion. The end is close.

---

### The Mansion Gates
📍 40.760, -104.370

The City Circle is chaos—refugees, peacekeepers, rebel forces closing in. You see the children gathered at the mansion gates, a human shield. Silver parachutes fall from a hovercraft. Gifts. Then the explosions start. The Mockingjay has reached her destination. The cost is beyond measure.
