## Waypoints

### Bywater Street, Chelsea
📍 51.4875, -0.1687
📏 1100m

The small terraced house with the blue door. Ann's things are still everywhere, though Ann herself is often elsewhere. You make tea and try not to think about Karla.

---

### The River, Chelsea Embankment
📍 51.4861, -0.1562
📏 1800m

The Thames at dawn. You walk along the water as the city wakes. In the grey light, every passing face could be a watcher. Old habits die hard.

---

### Sloane Square
📍 51.4970, -0.1595
📏 1400m

The morning papers, a slow coffee. You watch the street and let your mind work on the problem. In this trade, patience is the only virtue that matters.

---

### Buckingham Palace Road
📍 51.5014, -0.1419
📏 2200m

Past the Palace, through the tourists. You remember when this work felt noble. Before the betrayals. Before Bill Haydon smiled at you across the room.

---

### Hyde Park
📍 51.5074, -0.1657
📏 2800m

Long walks help you think. The grey water, the bare trees, the anonymous crowds. Somewhere in Moscow, your opposite number is walking too. Wondering about you.

---

### The London Library
📍 51.5095, -0.1395
📏 1200m

St James's Square. Research is meditation. You pull old files, cross-reference dates, build patterns from fragments. The mole has been here for years. But who?

---

### Whitehall
📍 51.5074, -0.1278
📏 850m

The corridors of power. Minister's offices and quiet lies. They want results but not the truth. They never want the truth.

---

### Cambridge Circus
📍 51.5117, -0.1302
📏 650m

The Circus. Fifth floor. You've been away too long, but the corridors remember you. Control is dead, and the house he built is rotten. Time to clean it.

---

### Soho
📍 51.5136, -0.1365
📏 2400m

Narrow streets, foreign voices, useful shadows. You meet a contact in a cafe that serves coffee too strong and asks no questions.

---

### Bloomsbury
📍 51.5179, -0.1080
📏 3200m

Safe houses and quiet meetings. A dusty room above a shop. Guillam brings the files you shouldn't have. The trap is almost ready now.

---

### Islington, Lock Gardens
📍 51.5362, -0.1028
📏 5500m

Another safe house. Worn carpets, a single lamp. Here you debrief the broken agents, the ones who came back wrong. You know how they feel.

---

### Hampstead Heath
📍 51.5615, -0.1477

The city falls away. On the Heath, you can almost believe in simple things again. But the wind is cold, and there's one more file to read.
