## Waypoints

### The Circus, Cambridge Circus
📍 51.5117, -0.1302
📏 1200m

The anonymous door to British Intelligence. Control has one final operation—but you must become the bait. Let them think you've been left out in the cold.

---

### Whitehall Debrief
📍 51.5074, -0.1278
📏 4200m

They ask about Berlin. About Karl. About everything that went wrong. You give them nothing useful. A burned-out case—that's what they need to see.

---

### Cheap Rooms, City Road
📍 51.5145, -0.0815
📏 5800m

A boarding house that smells of cabbage and failure. You drink too much. You let yourself go. The transformation must be complete.

---

### Bayswater Library
📍 51.5352, -0.1055
📏 4500m

Your cover job: assistant librarian. Liz Gold works here too. She sees something in you worth saving. She shouldn't get involved. None of them should.

---

### The Off-License, Marylebone
📍 51.5255, -0.1550
📏 3800m

You hit a man. Badly. The police are called. This is what Control wanted—a man with nothing left to lose, ripe for recruitment by the other side.

---

### Wormwood Scrubs Prison
📍 51.5015, -0.1796

Three months inside for assault. The degradation is complete. When you emerge, grey and hollow, East German intelligence will be waiting.
