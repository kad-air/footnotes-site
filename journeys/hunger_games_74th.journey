## Waypoints

### The Cornucopia
📍 35.000, -82.500
📏 8000m

The gong sounds. Sixty seconds of standing still on your metal plate, staring at the golden horn filled with weapons and supplies. Then chaos. You grab a backpack, dodge a knife, and sprint for the tree line. Behind you, the screams begin.

---

### Deep in the Forest
📍 35.070, -82.520
📏 10000m

You climb high into the trees as night falls. Below, the Career pack hunts with torches. Eleven cannons fired today—eleven dead. You try not to think about how many you knew. The anthem plays. Faces light the sky.

---

### The Burning Woods
📍 35.160, -82.540
📏 9000m

You wake to walls of fire. Not natural—too precise, too controlled. The Gamemakers are herding you. Fireballs explode against trees, singeing your jacket as you run. They want the tributes together. They want a show.

---

### The Tree Above the Careers
📍 35.230, -82.590
📏 8000m

Trapped in a tree, surrounded by the Career pack below. Then you spot it—a tracker jacker nest on a branch above. One careful cut with your knife. The golden swarm descends on the sleeping Careers. In the chaos, you grab a bow. You finally have a weapon.

---

### Rue's Canopy
📍 35.300, -82.620
📏 12000m

High in the branches, you find an ally—the small girl from District 11 who moves through the trees like a bird. She saved you once already. Together, you hatch a plan to destroy the Career's food supply.

---

### The Supply Pile
📍 35.400, -82.660
📏 7000m

The pyramid of supplies is rigged with mines. Three arrows into the hanging bag of apples sends them tumbling. The explosion shakes the arena. The Careers have nothing now—no food, no advantage. The game has changed.

---

### The Mockingjay Song
📍 35.460, -82.690
📏 10000m

You find Rue too late. The spear has already found her. You hold her hand and sing until the cannon fires. Then you cover her body with flowers—a message to the Capitol, to District 11, to everyone watching. You are not just a piece in their game.

---

### Peeta's Stream
📍 35.550, -82.720
📏 8000m

The rule change—two tributes from the same district can win. You find him half-dead, camouflaged in mud by the stream. His leg is infected, his fever high. You do what you must: play the star-crossed lovers for the cameras and pray for medicine.

---

### The Cave
📍 35.620, -82.760
📏 9000m

The silver parachute brings sleep syrup, but no cure. The Feast is announced—a pack for each surviving tribute, holding what they need most. You drug Peeta and go alone. Clove's knife finds your forehead. Thresh's rock finds Clove. "Just this once, Twelve. For Rue."

---

### The Final Showdown
📍 35.700, -82.800

The mutts drive you back to the Cornucopia—creatures with the eyes of the fallen tributes. You climb the golden horn, Peeta at your side, Cato in armor below. Hours pass. Dawn breaks. Two tributes remain. The berries come out. "Together?" "Together."
