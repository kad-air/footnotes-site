## Waypoints

### The Cornucopia
📍 35.186, -82.625
📏 8500m

The gong sounds. Sixty seconds of standing still, then a mad dash for supplies. You grab a backpack and run for the tree line.

---

### The Burning Woods
📍 35.195, -82.640
📏 12000m

Fireballs rain from the sky—the Gamemakers' way of pushing the tributes together. You struggle to breathe through the smoke.

---

### Rue's Hideout
📍 35.210, -82.660
📏 15000m

High in the canopy, a small ally saves your life. You share your food and your secrets, and for a moment, the Games feel far away.

---

### The Stream
📍 35.230, -82.630
📏 6000m

You follow the water, hunting for food and hope. The tracker jackers' stings still throb, but you've found Peeta's trail in the mud.

---

### The Cave
📍 35.240, -82.610
📏 18000m

Shelter in the rain. You play for the cameras, weaving a story of star-crossed lovers to win the hearts—and the medicine—of the sponsors.

---

### The Final Showdown
📍 35.186, -82.625

The mutts are howling. You stand atop the gold Cornucopia, Peeta by your side. Two tributes remain. One choice. 'Together?' 'Together.'
