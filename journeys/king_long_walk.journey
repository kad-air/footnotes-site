## Waypoints

### The Starting Line
47.3520, -68.3265
53000m

The border between Maine and Canada. One hundred boys stand at the starting line, waiting for
nine o'clock. Ray Garraty is number 47. McVries is 61. Stebbins stands alone at the back. The
soldiers check their weapons. At exactly 9 AM, the Long Walk begins. Four miles per hour.
Anything less means a warning. Three warnings and you're out of the Walk. Permanently.

### Caribou
46.8606, -68.0120
48000m

The first town. People line the streets, cheering, waving signs. You're still fresh, still
strong, still thinking you can win. Olson has already gotten his first warning. The pavement is
hard under your feet. The soldiers follow in their halftrack, patient as death. This is still
the easy part. You haven't started to hurt yet.

---

### Presque Isle
46.4280, -67.8590
65000m

Aroostook County stretches endlessly. Potato fields on either side of Route 1. Boys are
beginning to drop. You've learned not to look when the guns bark. McVries shares his concentrate
with you. Stebbins walks alone, saying nothing, always at the back. The crowd is thinner here.
The night is coming.

### Houlton
45.8420, -67.5680
78000m

You've walked through your first night. Your feet are raw meat. Baker talks about bread, always
about bread. Abraham has gone delirious, singing hymns until they gave him his ticket. The dawn
brings no comfort, only the relentless sun. Keep walking. Don't stop. Don't slow down. Four
miles per hour or the soldiers send you home in a bag.

---

### Medway
45.1850, -68.3120
85000m

Fewer than half remain. You've stopped counting the shots. Scramm has pneumonia but keeps
walking, keeps coughing, keeps dying one step at a time. The road curves southwest now, toward
Bangor. Jan is somewhere ahead, waiting. If you win, you get the Prize—anything you want for
the rest of your life. But all you want now is to stop walking.

---

### Bangor
44.4180, -68.7712
72000m

The city rises from the Maine wilderness. Huge crowds line the streets—thousands of people
screaming your name, throwing food, crying. The Major himself appears, waving from his
jeep. This is what you walked for. This is the glory. But Garraty can barely see through
his exhaustion. The pavement shimmers. Somewhere behind you, another gun barks.

---

### Augusta
43.8250, -69.4680
75000m

The state capital. You've lost track of the days. Twenty boys left? Fifteen? The faces blur
together. McVries is still here, still walking beside you, still making bad jokes. Stebbins
is still at the back. Your legs move without your permission. The Walk has become everything.
There is no before. There is no after. There is only the next step.

---

### Lewiston
43.1850, -70.0320
58000m

Crossing the Androscoggin River. You remember crossing rivers, though you can't remember their
names anymore. The crowds are enormous now—they've come from all over New England to see the
death march. A boy named Rattigan gives up, just sits down in the middle of the road. You don't
look back. You can't look back anymore.

---

### Portland
42.7020, -70.3150
72000m

The biggest city yet. The roar of the crowd is deafening. Barker is crying, has been crying for
twenty miles. There are maybe eight of you left. The ocean glints somewhere to the east.
McVries talks about his girlfriend, about swimming, about anything except walking. Stebbins
finally moves up from the back, and his eyes are completely empty.

---

### Kittery
42.0680, -70.8250
95000m

The Maine border. New Hampshire lies ahead. You've walked the entire length of Maine, north to
south. Four, maybe five of you are left. Your feet are hamburger. Your mind is hamburger. But
something keeps you moving—not the Prize anymore, not even survival. Just the inability to
imagine stopping. The Long Walk is all there is now.

### Danvers, Massachusetts
42.5751, -70.9545

A hand on your shoulder. The dark figure tells you that you've won, that you're the last one,
that it's over. But your legs won't stop. You shrug off the hand and keep walking, down the
road, into the darkness. The Long Walk has no ending. The Long Walk goes on forever. And
somewhere deep inside, Ray Garraty is still walking.
