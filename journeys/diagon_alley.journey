The cupboard under the stairs, the letters that kept coming, and a giant who knocked down the door. Today everything changes.

---

### The Leaky Cauldron
📍 51.459, -0.169
📏 120m

A grubby pub that Muggles walk past without seeing. Inside, everyone seems to know your name. The barman points you toward the back courtyard.

Three taps on the brick wall and the archway opens. Cobblestones, cauldrons, and wonders beyond imagination stretch before you.

### Gringotts Bank
📍 51.463, -0.164

The snowy white building towers above the alley. Goblins count gold behind the bronze doors, and deep below lies a vault you never knew existed.

---

### Madam Malkin's Robes
📍 51.465, -0.160
📏 380m

Standing on a footstool while enchanted tape measures flutter about. A pale boy with a pointed face talks about Quidditch and houses.

---

### Flourish and Blotts
📍 51.467, -0.156
📏 450m

Towering shelves of spellbooks, from basic charms to dangerous curses. The Standard Book of Spells awaits, along with texts you can barely pronounce.

Amber eyes blink from every perch. One snowy owl watches you with unusual intelligence. A birthday gift you'll never forget.

### Ollivanders
📍 51.471, -0.147

Dusty boxes stacked to the ceiling. The wand chooses the wizard, they say. Holly and phoenix feather—curious, very curious indeed.

---

### Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes
📍 51.473, -0.143

The bright orange shopfront is impossible to miss. Pygmy Puffs, Extendable Ears, and Skiving Snackboxes—the twins have outdone themselves.

---

### Knockturn Alley
📍 51.472, -0.145

A wrong turn down a darker path. Shrunken heads and cursed artifacts line the windows. Best not to linger here.

Platform 9¾ awaits between the barriers. Push through with your trolley and trunk—the scarlet engine will carry you to your new life.
